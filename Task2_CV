"Hello students! I wanted to let you know that the task I gave you is
based on the topics covered in our lectures from video 17 to video 25.
These lectures focused on advanced techniques in computer
vision and image processing, including color recognition, Reinhard color
transfer, simple and adaptive thresholding, and morphological
transformations. The task is designed to challenge you to apply your
knowledge and skills in these areas to a practical problem, and to
explore new and creative solutions to complex challenges. I hope you
find this task engaging, informative, and fun, and that it helps you
develop your expertise in computer vision and image processing. If you
have any questions or difficulties, don't hesitate to reach out to me or
to your fellow students for help. Good luck and have fun!"
Task 2 :
Write an OpenCV program that performs advanced color recognition,
Reinhard color transfer, adaptive thresholding, and morphological
transformations on a set of images. The program should take a set of
input images and perform the following steps:
1. Advanced color recognition: The program should identify and
classify the objects in the images based on their color, shape,
texture, and context. You can use advanced computer vision
techniques such as object detection, segmentation, feature
extraction, and machine learning to achieve this. You can also
use multiple color spaces, color models, and color histograms to
capture the color information of the objects.
2. Reinhard color transfer: The program should adjust the color
balance of the objects in the images so that they look more
natural, realistic, and consistent across different lighting
conditions and cameras. You can use the Reinhard algorithm or
other color transfer methods such as histogram matching, color
transfer by interpolation, or color transfer by optimization. You
can also apply spatial constraints, color constraints, or perceptual
constraints to preserve the local and global structure of the
images.
3. Adaptive thresholding: The program should use a combination of
global and local thresholding techniques to segment the objects in
the images. You can use pre-processing steps such as color
normalization, noise reduction, and contrast enhancement to
improve the quality of the images. You can then use global
thresholding to separate the background from the foreground,
and local thresholding to refine the boundaries and remove the
noise and artifacts. You can also use adaptive thresholding to
handle the variations in illumination, contrast, and texture.
4. Morphological transformations: The program should apply a set of
advanced morphological operations to the segmented objects in
the images. You can use operations such as skeletonization,
thinning, pruning, filling, and smoothing to extract the shape,
topology, and geometry of the objects. You can also use
operations such as dilation, erosion, opening, and closing to
modify the size, position, and connectivity of the objects. You can
also combine different operations to create more complex
transformations.
The output of the program should be a set of annotated images that
show the results of each step. You can use different visualization
techniques (e.g. bounding boxes, masks, contours, overlays, etc.) to
highlight the objects of interest and the changes in color, shape, and
texture. You can also use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1
score to evaluate the performance of the program. You can also
use user feedback to improve the accuracy and usability of the
program.
I hope this more challenging task pushes you to explore the state-ofthe-art in computer vision and image processing, and to develop new
and innovative solutions to complex problems. Good luck and have fun
experimenting!
